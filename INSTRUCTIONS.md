## Ten Pins Bowling

### Rules of the game
    * A game has 10 frames
    * Each frame has 10 pins that can be knocked down
    * In each frame, the player has two attempts at knocking down pins
    * The pins are reset back at the end of each frame

### Strikes

A strike is scored when all 10 pins are knocked down in one go
  - When a strike is scored, we move on to the next frame &amp; the pins are reset
  - Strikes provide bonus points, where the value of the next two balls is added into the score of the strike frame
  - For example: a strike is bowled in the first frame. In the second frame, the next two balls score a 7 and 1: So the score for the first strike is (10+7+1) and the total score for the two rounds is (10+7+1) + (7+1) = 26

### Spares

A spare is scored when all 10 pins are knocked down in two goes in a frame
  - Spares, provide bonus points, where the value of the next ball is added to the score of the spare frame
  - For example: a spare is bowled in the first frame. In the second frame, the next two balls score a 2 and 6: So the score for the first strike is (10+2) and the total score for the two rounds is (10+2) + (2+6) = 20

### End of the game

In the tenth frame only, if a player rolls a spare or strike, an extra roll is permitted to finish that frame, but no more that three balls can be rolled


### Your task

    • Think about how to model the game, and how to test it
    • You don’t need a graphical interface
    • You can use the web for searches, documentation, anything you want
    • Take as many breaks as you need
